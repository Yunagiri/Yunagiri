# ðŸ’¬ About me ðŸ’¬ 

Hi! My name is Lucien, autonomous stuff enthousiast. 

I am specialized in Systems, Networking and Telecommunications and am heavily interested in the idea of bringing intelligence to the edge: Robots, autonomous decision makings, electronics and communication between sensors... all these notions speak to me. 

Senior member of the club of Robotics of my university, I am currently working as a wireless firmware engineer intern at Schneider Electric, in the Connected Systems division. My main line of work is the evaluation of a concurrent multi-protocol Zigbee/OpenThread stack, this includes setting up a test environement, scripting said tests, and analyzing results to present the state of the art. 

I work at Schneider Electric at the moment of writing this, as a Wireless Firmware Design Engineer, my main focus is the Thread protocol and multiprotocol stacks.

(It doesn't really show because Schneider has its own GitHub Enterprise instance, but I mainly work in Python and C nowadays!)
