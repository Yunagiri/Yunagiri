# ðŸ’¬ About me ðŸ’¬ 

Hi! My name is Viet Phuong DINH, graduate engineering student at the french university UTT. 

I am specialized in Systems, Networking and Telecommunications and am heavily interested in the idea of bringing intelligence to the edge: Robots, autonomous decision makings, electronics and communication between sensors... all these notions speak to me. 

Senior member of the club of Robotics of my university, I am currently working as a wireless firmware engineer intern at Schneider Electric, in the Connected Systems division. My main line of work is the evaluation of a concurrent multi-protocol Zigbee/OpenThread stack, this includes setting up a test environnement, scripting said tests, and analyzing results to present the state of the art.
